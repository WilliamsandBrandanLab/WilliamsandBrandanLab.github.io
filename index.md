# Welcome to the Williams and Brandon lab analysis website!
## Douglas Mental Health University Institute 

Our conjoined source of information and code for both the Williams and Brandon laboratories at the Douglas Hospital. 
You will find links to papers, programs, and coding packages used to help with analysis in cell registration, neural coding, and more! Aiming to understand how large neuronal populations code for different aspects of memory, we have created this as a way to help share our ideas to achieve just that.
