# About 

Ours labs are located at the [Douglas Mental Health University Institute](http://www.douglas.qc.ca/?locale=en), a research center in Montreal, Quebec. Since increasing our studies to in vivo experiments, we have developed and collaborated with many scientists and engineers on creating advanced analysis packages to register large and small neuronal circuits. Revealing the identity and activity patterns of neurons in the hippocampus and septum using calcium imaging recordings with [miniscopes](http://miniscope.org/index.php/Main_Page) in combination to optogenetics and electrophysiology in freely moving mice performing memory tasks. The overarching goal is to understand the neuronal mechanisms underlying normal memory function in normal and in pathological conditions such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease in mice models.
