# About 

The lab is located at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute, a research center part of McGill University in 
Montreal. The lab has evolved significantly since the labs inception from in vitro approaches aiming to better
understanding individual neuronal function and local circuits to in vivo experiments aiming to understand how 
large neuronal populations code for different aspects of memory. At the beginning, we used brain slices to identify 
and differentiate neuronal populations of the hippocampus and the medial septum, two brain regions critical for
learning and memory. For example, we initially discovered in the medial septum a new population of neurons using 
glutamate as a transmitter(Sotty et al., 2003). These neurons were also shown to send projections to many different
brain areas including the hippocampus. Later on, we developed the isolated hippocampus preparation and the isolated 
septo-hippocampus preparation (Goutagny et al., 2009). These preparations were extremely valuable because it 
offered a unique opportunity to determine the interactions of GABAergic interneurons and principal cells during 
intrinsically-generated oscillatory activity such as theta and gamma rhythms (Amilhon et al., 2015).
In the last 5 years, the laboratory has now concentrated all its efforts ininvestigating how identified neurons 
of the septum and hippocampus code for memory in vivo. In addition to revealing the identity and activity patterns
of neurons in the hippocampus and septum using calcium imaging recorded with ‘miniscopes’ in combination to 
optogenetics and electrophysiology in freely moving mice performing memory tasks, we also investigate the role of 
these neurons in sleep (Boyce et al., 2016). The overarching goal is to understand the neuronal mechanisms underlying
normal memory function in normal and in pathological conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease inmice models.
