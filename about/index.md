# About 

Our labs are located at the [Douglas Mental Health University Institute](http://www.douglas.qc.ca/?locale=en), a research center in Montreal, Quebec. Since our increased practices to in vivo experiments, we have developed advanced analysis packages to register large and small neuronal circuits. Recording calcium activity with [miniscope](http://miniscope.org/index.php/Main_Page) technology we are able to record neuronal activity in combination with optogenetics and electrophysiology in freely moving mice. Revealing the identity and activity patterns of neurons in the hippocampus and septum. The overarching goal is to understand the neuronal mechanisms underlying normal memory function in normal and in pathological conditions such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease in mice models.
